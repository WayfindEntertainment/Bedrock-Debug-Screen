# What Does This Pack Do?

Minecraft Bedrock lacks a debug screen (unless you have one of the developers' copies, that is). If you have played the Java version, you might be familiar with how useful that screen is. This behavior pack brings some of that functionality into Bedrock.


# Adding It To Your Worlds

## How to Install

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/WayfindEntertainment/Bedrock-Debug-Screen/releases/latest) of the addon. Once downloaded, double click it to run. Minecraft will automatically import the addon.

Your world will need to enable the Beta APIs in the game settings for this addon to work. Please note that this is an irreversible setting change for this world.

## Using In Game

Once you are playing, bring up the chat menu (default key binding is <kbd>T</kbd>). Then, type

    !debug on

and press enter. When you close the chat window, you'll now see a debug screen like this:

![Bedrock debug screenshot in action](./images/Debug%20screen%20in%20action.jpg)

When you no longer want to see this information, open the chat menu again and type

    !debug off

then press enter. Now when you close the window that debug screen will go away.

## Troubleshooting

### Requesting dependency on beta APIs

```bash
[Scripting][error]-Plugin [Minecraft Bedrock Debug Screen - 2.0.0] - requesting dependency on beta APIs [@minecraft/server - 1.12.0-beta], but the Beta APIs experiment is not enabled.
```

You have activated the add-on correctly, but you need to activate the Beta APIs in your game settings.

### Unknown command: !

```bash
Unknown command: !. Please check that the command exists and that you have prmission to use it.
```

You have accidentally entered the command with the `/` preceding the `!`. You must remove the slash before entering the command.

### Requesting Invalid Module Version

If you get an error similar to this:
```bash
[Scripting][error]-Plugin [Minecraft Bedrock Debug Screen] - module [Minecraft Bedrock Debug Screen - 2.1.1] requesting invalid module version [@minecraft/server - 2.0.0-beta].

Current [beta] version is [2.1.0-beta].

Available versions:
0.1.0
1.19.0
2.1.0-beta
3.0.0-alpha
```

it means the latest official Minecraft API has updated. The only way to resolve this is by updating the manifest to the new version and reloading the addon. [Submit a ticket][choose issue] to let me know that it needs fixing!

## Debug Screen Limitations

- To prevent run time errors from trying to access blocks or entities in unloaded chunks, the "Looking at Block" section will say "None" if the block is out of ticking distance.
- The official API has no way to calculate block lighting levels or biome types.

***REMEMBER THIS IS A PROJECT WITH CHILDREN AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE TARGET AUDIENCE!***

While I don't expect most children to delve into the intricacies of software development, the older they get the more likely they are to search things like this out. And even if they don't come to this particular project repository, they are still the target audience of the developed mod itself. Therefore, keep the rating for this project at a PG level or better.
